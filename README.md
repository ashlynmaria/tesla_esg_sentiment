Tesla ESG Sentiment Analyzer
============================

üöÄ Project Overview
-------------------

The **Tesla ESG Sentiment Analyzer** is an end-to-end data science project designed to extract, analyze, and visualize sentiment from Tesla's ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) related news data sourced from GDELT. This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow, including data loading, cleaning, sentiment extraction, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQLite database integration, SQL querying, and data export for Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

This analyzer is built for modularity and reusability, making it suitable for production environments and serving as a robust portfolio piece.

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
-------------------------

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/Tesla-ESG-Sentiment-Analyzer.git](https://github.com/your-username/Tesla-ESG-Sentiment-Analyzer.git)
cd Tesla-ESG-Sentiment-Analyzer
```
### 2\. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3\. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**requirements.txt content:**

```bash
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
plotly
sqlite3 # Usually built-in with Python, but good to list
warnings # Built-in
re # Built-in
```

_(Note: sqlite3, warnings, re, logging, datetime, timedelta, and collections are part of Python's standard library and typically don't need explicit installation.)_

### 4\. Data Preparation

Place your tesla\_esg.csv file inside the data/ directory. If the file is not found, the script will automatically generate sample data for demonstration purposes.

üèÉ How to Run
-------------

After setting up the environment and data, you can run the sentiment analyzer by executing the main.py script.

1.  **Ensure your Python script is named main.py** (or adjust the command below).
    
2.  python main.py
    

The script will perform the following actions:

*   Load the data (or create sample data if tesla\_esg.csv is not found).
    
*   Clean and preprocess the data.
    
*   Perform EDA, generating plots that will be saved in artifacts/plots/.
    
*   Store the cleaned data and daily sentiment summaries in tesla\_esg.db.
    
*   Execute and display results of several SQL queries.
    
*   Export enhanced data to tesla\_esg\_cleaned\_for\_bi.csv for BI tools.
    

üìà Analysis and Visualizations
------------------------------

The project generates several key visualizations and insights during the EDA phase:

### Tesla ESG Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

A comprehensive dashboard showing:

*   **Daily Average Sentiment Over Time**: Track the trend of sentiment scores.
    
*   **Sentiment Score Distribution**: Understand the overall spread of sentiment.
    
*   **Daily Article Count**: Monitor the volume of news coverage.
    
*   **Sentiment Distribution by Category**: Breakdown of articles into 'Very Negative', 'Negative', 'Positive', and 'Very Positive' categories.
    

_(These plots are saved as sentiment\_dashboard.png in the artifacts/plots/ directory.)_

### ESG Theme Analysis

Visualizations detailing:

*   **Top 10 Most Common Themes**: Identify prevailing topics in the news data.
    
*   **ESG Theme Distribution**: A pie chart showing the proportion of news articles categorized under Environmental, Social, Governance, Economic, Technology, and Political themes.
    

_(These plots are saved as esg\_theme\_analysis.png in the artifacts/plots/ directory.)_

üìä Database and BI Export
-------------------------

The project leverages SQLite for persistent data storage, allowing for efficient querying.

The store\_to\_database() method populates two tables:

*   tesla\_esg: Contains the cleaned, article-level data.
    
*   daily\_sentiment: Stores daily aggregated sentiment metrics.
    

Additionally, the export\_data\_for\_bi() method generates tesla\_esg\_cleaned\_for\_bi.csv, which includes:

*   Original cleaned data.
    
*   Calculated fields like absolute sentiment, positive/negative flags, week/quarter.
    
*   **7-day and 30-day rolling average sentiment scores**, crucial for trend analysis in BI tools.
    
*   A separate summary statistics CSV providing an overview of key metrics.
    

üí° Future Enhancements
----------------------

*   **Advanced NLP Models**: Implement more sophisticated pre-trained NLP models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for more nuanced sentiment analysis, potentially fine-tuned on financial/ESG text.
    
*   **Real-time Data Ingestion**: Integrate with GDELT's real-time API or other news APIs for continuous data updates.
    
*   **Interactive Web Dashboard**: Build a web-based dashboard using Streamlit, Dash, or Flask to visualize results dynamically without requiring local Python execution for end-users.
    
*   **Topic Modeling**: Apply topic modeling (e.g., LDA, NMF) to discover latent themes beyond predefined ESG categories.
    
*   **Anomaly Detection**: Implement algorithms to detect unusual spikes or drops in sentiment that might indicate significant events.
    
*   **Configuration File**: Externalize configuration parameters (e.g., data\_path, db\_name) into a config.ini or settings.py file.
